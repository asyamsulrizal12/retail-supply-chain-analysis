# Retail Supply Chain Analysis

Welcome to the **Retail Supply Chain Analysis** repository.  
This project showcases a complete end-to-end analytics workflow for retail supply chain management, combining **data science, machine learning, and operations research** to deliver actionable insights for both strategic and operational decision-making.

---

## ✨ Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – uncover demand trends, anomalies, and seasonality.
- **Forecasting** – apply statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to predict future sales.
- **Segmentation** – classify customers and products for targeted strategies.
- **Returns Analysis** – identify high-return categories and propose reduction strategies.
- **Optimization** – minimize logistics costs while meeting demand requirements.
- **Simulation** – model uncertainty with Monte Carlo methods to assess risk exposure.
