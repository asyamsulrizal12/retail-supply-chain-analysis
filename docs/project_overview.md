# Project Overview

The **Retail Supply Chain Analysis** project provides a structured, end-to-end approach to understanding and improving supply chain performance. It integrates **data-driven forecasting, optimization, and simulation** to support strategic and operational decision-making.

## Scope
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – uncover demand trends, anomalies, and seasonality
2. **Forecasting** – predict future sales using Prophet, ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU
3. **Segmentation** – classify customers and products for targeted strategies
4. **Returns Analysis** – evaluate product return patterns and costs
5. **Long-Term Projection** – scenario-based forecasting for strategic planning
6. **Optimization** – minimize logistics costs while meeting demand requirements
7. **Simulation** – assess uncertainty through Monte Carlo methods

## Strategic Value
- Provides **insights for managers** to balance cost efficiency and service reliability
- Offers **scenario planning** for long-term growth and risk mitigation
- Demonstrates **technical rigor** for recruiters and stakeholders
