# Methodology

This project applies a combination of **statistical, machine learning, and operations research techniques** to analyze and improve supply chain performance.

## Steps
- **Data Preparation**  
  Cleaning, merging, and structuring datasets for analysis.

- **Forecasting Models**  
  Prophet, ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, GRU – each chosen for specific strengths in trend detection, short-term accuracy, and long-term sensitivity.

- **Segmentation**  
  Clustering and classification to identify customer/product groups for targeted strategies.

- **Returns Analysis**  
  Quantitative evaluation of product returns to identify high-risk categories.

- **Optimization**  
  Linear Programming with PuLP to allocate inventory efficiently, minimizing logistics costs while meeting demand.

- **Simulation**  
  Monte Carlo framework to model demand variability, shipping delays, and raw material price changes.

- **Evaluation**  
  KPIs include cost, service level, profit, and scenario outcomes.

## Professional Impact
This methodology ensures both **analytical depth** and **practical relevance**, making it suitable for supply chain managers, recruiters, and decision-makers.
